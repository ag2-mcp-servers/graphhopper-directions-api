It must be either of type `in_same_route`, `in_sequence` or `in_direct_sequence`.\n\n`in_same_route`: As the name suggest, it enforces the specified services or shipments to be in the same route. It can be specified as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n   "type": "in_same_route",\n   "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"]\n}\n```\n\nThis enforces service i to be in the same route as service j no matter which vehicle will be employed. If a specific vehicle (driver) is required to conduct this, just add a `vehicle_id` like this:\n\n```\n{\n   "type": "in_same_route",\n   "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"],\n   "vehicle_id": "vehicle1"\n}\n```\n\nThis not only enforce service i and j to be in the same route, but also makes sure that both services are in the route of `vehicle1`.\n\n*Tip*: This way initial loads and vehicle routes can be modelled. For example, if your vehicles are already on the road and new orders come in, then vehicles can still be rescheduled subject to the orders that have already been assigned to these vehicles.\n\n\n\n`in_sequence`: This relation type enforces n jobs to be in sequence. It can be specified as\n\n```json\n{\n   "type": "in_sequence",\n   "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id"]\n}\n```\n\nwhich means that service j need to be in the same route as service i AND it needs to occur somewhere after service i. As described above if a specific vehicle needs to conduct this, just add `vehicle_id`.\n\n\n`in_direct_sequence`: This enforces n services or shipments to be in direct sequence. It can be specified as\n\n```json\n{\n   "type": "in_direct_sequence",\n   "ids": ["serv_i_id","serv_j_id","serv_k_id"]\n}\n```\n\nyielding service j to occur directly after service i, and service k to occur directly after service j i.e. in strong order. Again, a vehicle can be assigned a priority by adding a `vehicle_id` to the relation.\n\n\n*Special IDs*:\nIf you look at the previous example and you want service i to be the first in the route, use the special ID `start` as follows:\n\n```json\n{\n   "type": "in_direct_sequence",\n   "ids": ["start","serv_i_id","serv_j_id","serv_k_id"]\n}\n```\n\nLatter enforces the direct sequence of i, j and k at the beginning of the route.

To also consider sequences of the pickups and deliveries of your shipments, you need to use a special ID, i.e. use the shipment id plus the keyword `_pickup` or `_delivery`.

In case of one vehicle, switching from `min` to `min-max` should not have any impact.\nIf you have more than one vehicle, then the algorithm tries to constantly move stops from one vehicle to another such that\nthe completion time of longest vehicle route can be further reduced.
